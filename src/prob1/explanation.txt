the reason p1.equals(p2) is false because the Parent Person isn't an instance of PersonwithJob. Has the parent can't be an
instanceOf the child but rather the child can be an instance of the parent. The parent can't be substituted with the child.
The equals used comes from the child hence the reason why its false but on the other hand as the parent type can be substituted
for the child in order words the child is an instance of the parent and both object have the same name hence it returns true for it
